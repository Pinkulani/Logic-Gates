# Logic Gates

Here are all the Digital Logic Gates built with [Logisim](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution). <br>
I'm using Logisim Version: 3.8.0

It's not possible to create the basic gates like AND-Gate with their electric components. Logisim is working in the digital True/False space. <br><br>
**Note:** A AND-Gate can be built using NAND-Gate and NOR-Gate which means using a AND-Gate in a circuit is just using the same components for that gate over and over again. Instead of an AND-Gate you could place multiple NAND-Gate or NOR-Gate.
